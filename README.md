The basic course workshops where I used jQuery can be found in the workshop folder.
The only extra that I used SCSS to make it simplier.

For the todo-list and the gallery (my-first-app) I also used TypeScript, localStorage, JSON and Fetch API.

I also learned from The Net Ninja's Modern JavaScript course at Udemy.
So I used in this two main projects what I learned there to practice Array methods, Async code and other features of JavaScript and TypeScript.

In the documents folder I shared my certificate because I really enjoyed this small course.
